# StorPC

**StorPC** is a lightweight Go-based system designed to facilitate structured remote procedure workflows in a distributed environment. It conceptualizes data operations and processing tasks as discrete, chainable procedures, allowing them to be executed, monitored, and composed dynamically across different nodes.

The system operates by parsing procedure definitions, serializing data structures, and managing execution flow in a way that mimics a local function call while actually performing work across distributed storage or compute endpoints. Each procedure encapsulates both the data it requires and the actions it performs, ensuring a clear, repeatable process from input to output.

By combining serialization, procedural abstraction, and execution orchestration, StorPC provides a working process where developers can define tasks once and have them run reliably across a distributed environment, preserving structure, type information, and execution semantics.
